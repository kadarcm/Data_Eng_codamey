# Data Engineering Portfolio
[Codemey](https://www.codecademy.com/learn)

This Repository is ment to hold Portfolio progect that Codemey required to complete the Data Engineering Carrer path. I should point out the obvious that the Carrrer path included much more work than is shown here by way of lessions projects and aticals.

    1) [City Bike](./bike-rental/) This was the first portfolio project in the carrer path it was centered around reading CSVs cleaning the data and inserting into postgres

    2) [Cademycode](./cademycode/) This is the second portfolio project in the carrer path and it is centerd around a data pipline where a database is read into pandas and some cleaning and filling is preformed then outputed to anther Database.
        Topics in the project
        - Database operations
        - pandas
        - logging
        - powershell scripting (I didnt feel like installing WinSubShell)
        - argparsing
        - pytest
